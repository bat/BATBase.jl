# BATBase.jl

**Note: Integration of BATBase.jl with BAT.jl is not complete yet.**

BATBase.jl contains the core interface definition of [BAT.jl](https://github.com/bat/BAT.jl).

BATBase.jl will serve as a lightweight and low-dependency package that packages
implementing BAT-compatible densities and algorithms can depend on instead
of the full BAT.jl.
